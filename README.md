Hello there,

This is a project i'm doing thank to www.rocketseat.com.br.
I'm learning to use HTML with CSS and Javascript to make a nice website, also for mobile.
The project is a platform of study. You can either be a teacher or a student, you decide.

This repository is the final challenger to get a schollarship at www.rocketseat.com.br.

Wish me luck!!

And remeber, no one is too old to learn, or too young to teach.

Stay safe everyone!
